# TuxCare


The TuxCare services automate, simplify, and enhance Linux operations, giving organizations more flexibility in managing Linux distro choices and versions, significant maintenance cost reductions, and greatly enhanced security and compliance postures.


TuxCare, which is an expansion of the CloudLinuxâ€™s KernelCare and Extended Lifecycle Support brands, helps organizations take care of support, maintenance, and security for Enterprise Linux systems.

With [TuxCare Live Patching Services](/live-patching-services/), Linux kernels, libraries, databases, virtualizations and IoT devices receive automated security patches applied with zero downtime.

Using the [TuxCare Extended Lifecycle Support](/extended-lifecycle-support/) services, you can migrate to the newest version of Linux at your own pace while maintaining protection from the common risks of running an end-of-life distro.

[TuxCare Enterprise Support](/enterprise-support-for-almalinux/) provides a TuxCare-vetted repository of AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux updates with 16 years of support coverage. It also delivers an extended lifecycle with FIPS-compliant security patches for select minor versions and helps avoid costly upfront support package fees with pay-as-you-go hourly support bundles.

Users requiring FIPS-certified Linux deployments can download and install our [Community FIPS packages for AlmaLinux 9.2](https://docs.tuxcare.com/enterprise-support-for-almalinux/fips/) (kernel and openssl) for free for non-commercial use. Commercial applications should use our [Extended Security Updates](https://docs.tuxcare.com/enterprise-support-for-almalinux/#extended-security-updates) product, which offers the full suite of five FIPS 140-3 modules (kernel, openssl, libcrypt, nss and gnutls), FIPS-compliant security updates, and technical support.

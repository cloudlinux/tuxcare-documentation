# TuxCare


The TuxCare services automate, simplify, and enhance Linux operations, giving organizations more flexibility in managing Linux distro choices and versions, significant maintenance cost reductions, and greatly enhanced security and compliance postures.


TuxCare, which is an expansion of the CloudLinuxâ€™s KernelCare and Extended Lifecycle Support brands, helps organizations take care of support, maintenance, and security for Enterprise Linux systems.

With [TuxCare Live Patching Services](/live-patching-services/), Linux kernels, libraries, databases, virtualizations and IoT devices receive automated security patches applied with zero downtime.

Using the [TuxCare Extended Lifecycle Support](/extended-lifecycle-support/) services, you can migrate to the newest version of Linux at your own pace while maintaining protection from the common risks of running an end-of-life distro.

[AlmaCare](/almacare/) brings essential support and a 16-year long lifecycle to AlmaLinux systems. It comes with high value extensions that enable compliance with the FIPS 140-3 standard as well as rapid security updates.

Description of Support Program</h3><h4 id="accessing-technical-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#accessing-technical-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Accessing Technical Support</h4><p>AlmaCare Technical Support is designed for enterprise clients with trained IT staffs which provide initial ‘1st-line’ support to triage incidents. Customer and AlmaCare will agree on Customer Technical Leads with the client, who will be entitled to access AlmaCare Technical Support services; Customer Technical Leads must complete AlmaLinux training requirements. Customer Technical Leads may submit Technical Support Incidents and Service Requests to:</p><ol><li>AlmaCare Technical Support ticketing system:</li></ol><ul><li>Acceptance of requests 24 hours a day, 365 days a year</li><li>Unlimited number of tickets may be submitted</li><li>Customers will be supplied with instructions describing use of the AlmaCare ticketing system during on-boarding</li><li>User accounts will be created for each nominated user within each client organization</li><li>User accounts will have access to log, view and respond to tickets</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Email: acceptance of requests 24 hours a day, 365 days a year:</li></ol><ul><li>New tickets may be created by simply emailing the AlmaCare support desk (email address to be provided during on-boarding)</li></ul><p>All customers are entitled to access the Support knowledgebase, FAQs, and other self-service tools as may be offered by AlmaCare.</p><h4 id="response-time" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#response-time" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Response Time</h4><p>When submitting a ticket, Customers will select the appropriate Severity Level, as defined in Appendix A, from a drop-down list; AlmaCare reserves the right to change the Severity Level based on available information. TuxCare will use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests within the initial response times described below, based on the Severity Level of the incident.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Severity Level</th><th style="text-align:left;">Essential Support</th><th style="text-align:left;">Enhanced Support</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td style="text-align:left;">2 hours</td><td style="text-align:left;">30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td style="text-align:left;">12 hours</td><td style="text-align:left;">2 hours</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td style="text-align:left;">2 business days</td><td style="text-align:left;">12 hours</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style="text-align:left;">5 business days</td><td style="text-align:left;">2 business days</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="incident-resolution-cooperation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#incident-resolution-cooperation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Incident Resolution Cooperation</h4><p>Some incidents may require reproduction by AlmaCare for the purpose of testing and verifying a product error. Customer agrees to provide AlmaCare with all information which may be necessary for reproducing the condition under which the incident will re-occur and could be examined.</p><p>AlmaCare will endeavor to reproduce the incident as soon as all the necessary information and software and/or hardware is provided. If the incident could not be reproduced, Customer should grant to AlmaCare supervised remote access to the malfunctioning system. If the incident cannot be reproduced by either party, or Customer did not grant access to the network environment where the incident could be reproduced, or if it is detected that the incident’s cause lies beyond the Product, the incident cannot be classified within this Support Program.</p><p>An incident may at any time be either on the Customer’s side (i.e., Customer is taking actions that will promote/expedite the resolution of the issue by AlmaCare) or on the AlmaLinux side. An incident is on the Customer’s side when AlmaCare engineers request information from the Customer. When Customer provides the requested information to AlmaCare, the incident is considered to be on the side of the latter. The period during which the incident may be on the Customer’s side is limited to one calendar week. If the Customer’s response is overdue, the incident is closed by timeout.</p><h3 id="appendices" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#appendices" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Appendices</h3><h4 id="appendix-a-incident-severity-levels" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#appendix-a-incident-severity-levels" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Appendix A.

First, you need to generate an API token using ePortal admin UI. Then you can put it in the <em>X-Api-Key</em> http header. In this case the Authorization header is no longer needed. If for some reason the &quot;X-Api-Key&quot; header doesn&#39;t work for you, you can define your own header name in the API_AUTH_HEADER setting in eportal.conf.</p><p>In general ePortal API is configuration management friendly and idempotent. You don&#39;t need to make additional request to check existing state. For example entity deletion doesn&#39;t raise an error in case there is no such entity.

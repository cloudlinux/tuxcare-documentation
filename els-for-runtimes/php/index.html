While it tries not to break backward compatibility this is not guaranteed either if a change seems beneficial for interactive use. All features of <code>apt</code> are available in dedicated APT tools like <code>apt-get</code> and <code>apt-cache</code> as well.  <code>apt</code> just changes the default value of some options. Therefore, we recommend using these commands (potentially with some additional options enabled) as they keep backward compatibility as much as possible.</p></div></li></ol><h3 id="useful-commands-and-usage-of-php-els" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#useful-commands-and-usage-of-php-els" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Useful Commands and Usage of PHP ELS</h3><p>When you deploy an updated version of PHP through PHP ELS, using your system&#39;s regular update tool (yum, dnf, apt) the new version will be installed under <code>/opt/alt/php[version]/</code>. This means that all modules, configurations and additional files pertaining to this version will be contained inside that path. Different versions of PHP will each have their own path and can coexist without issues on the same system.

Our severity rating system for patching vulnerabilities integrates both NVD scoring and vendor scoring (when available). When the vendor&#39;s score is lower than the NVD score, we prioritize the NVD score.</p><p>Aligning with many industry standards and regulatory requirements, TuxCare is committed to delivering timely security updates. For instance, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates that all &#39;High&#39; vulnerabilities (CVSS score of 7.0+) must be addressed within 30 days. Other regulations and standards, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) for government agencies, uphold similar requirements.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Vulnerability coverage.</strong> TuxCare shall provide security patches for critical- and high-risk (CVSS 7.0 and above), medium-risk (CVSS 4.0 to 6.9), and low-risk (CVSS 0.1 to 3.9) vulnerabilities.

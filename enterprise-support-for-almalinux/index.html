Customers who want to remain with the specific AlmaLinux or Rocky Linux minor release for longer can opt for Extended Security Updates (ESU).</p><p>ESU delivers an extended period of security fixes for critical and high-risk vulnerabilities for select minor versions, as well as the full suite of five FIPS-validated modules (kernel, openssl, libcrypt, nss and gnutls) and FIPS-compliant security patches for FIPS-certified Linux deployments. The product also unlocks commercial use of the FIPS-validated packages.</p><p>Extended Security Updates are currently available for AlmaLinux 9.2, AlmaLinux 9.6, Rocky Linux 9.6, and planned support for 9.10. This provision ensures that a given minor release continues to receive essential updates, allowing customers to avoid upgrading every six months and test/certify their applications against the next minor version at their own pace.</p><p><img src="/images/esu_lifecycle_graph2.png" alt="esu lifecycle"></p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title"></p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Minor releases planned for ESU are subject to change. TuxCare reserves the right to change them at any time without prior notice.</p></div><h3 id="vulnerability-coverage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vulnerability-coverage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Vulnerability coverage</h3><p>TuxCare employs the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3) to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities. Our severity rating system for patching vulnerabilities integrates both NVD scoring and vendor scoring (when available). When the vendor&#39;s score is lower than the NVD score, we give priority to the NVD score. ESU provides security patches for High and Critical vulnerabilities (with a 7+ CVSS score) and urgent priority bug fixes. This strategy aims to reduce changes in the environment, prioritizing stability without compromising critical security.</p><h3 id="fips-compliant-security-patches" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fips-compliant-security-patches" aria-hidden="true">#</a> FIPS-compliant security patches</h3><p>ESU enables continuous security for FIPS-certified AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux 9 deployments by offering FIPS-compliant security patches for the FIPS-validated <a href="https://tuxcare.com/fips-for-almalinux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kernel, openssl, libcrypt, nss and gnutls packages</a>. These patches <a href="https://tuxcare.com/blog/the-dilemmas-of-fips-140-3-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not change the validated cryptography</a>. They are suitable for organizations that don&#39;t require strict FIPS-certified implementations that are static and never patched (i.e. military or intelligence agencies). In case of a cryptographic vulnerability that will require a security patch that changes the validated cryptography, we will fix it by delivering a new packaged module. This module will undergo an expedited FIPS 140-3 re-validation to ensure it is attested to conform to FIPS 140-3 requirements.</p><h3 id="target-response-times" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#target-response-times" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Target response times</h3><p>Aligning with many industry standards and regulatory requirements, TuxCare is committed to delivering timely security updates. For instance, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates that all &#39;High&#39; vulnerabilities (CVSS score of 7.0+) must be addressed within 30 days. Other regulations and standards, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare organizations or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) for government agencies, uphold similar requirements. We aim to deliver security patches for Critical and High-risk vulnerabilities (CVSS 7+) within 14 days from when the vulnerabilities become publicly disclosed. This rapid response time significantly reduces the window of opportunity for potential attackers and meets most security regulation requirements.</p><h3 id="supported-packages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#supported-packages" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Supported packages</h3><p>ESU provides updates for a comprehensive list of packages integral to server operations - the complete list of over 6,000 packages in BaseOS and AppStream, plus a few more - thus providing maximum security for your operating system.

To install <code>tuxctl</code> you need to install the <code>tuxcare-release</code> package first. This package contains the TuxCare repo definitions, TuxCare GPG key and the <code>tuxctl</code> setup tool. Run one of the following as root:</p><p>For 9.2:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code># dnf -y install https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/tuxcare-release-latest-9.2.noarch.rpm

</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>The second step is to activate your license on the system. You should run the <code>tuxctl</code> tool as root with your ESU license key provided as a command line argument like so:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code># tuxctl --license-key XXXXXXXXXX
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>This tool will do the following:</p><ol><li>Check your OS and architecture</li><li>Check your license key for validity and purchased extensions</li><li>Check if your system is already registered</li><li>Register to CloudLinux Network</li><li>Obtain a token to access the restricted TuxCare repos</li><li>Enable the TuxCare ESU repo</li><li>Switch the default AlmaLinux repos to use repo.tuxcare.com</li><li>Import the TuxCare GPG key</li></ol><p>After installation you&#39;ll see the following message:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>TuxCare installed successfully

Customer agrees to provide TuxCare with all information which may be necessary for reproducing the condition under which the incident will re-occur and could be examined.</p><p>TuxCare will endeavor to reproduce the incident as soon as all the necessary information and software and/or hardware is provided. If the incident could not be reproduced, Customer should grant TuxCare a supervised remote access to the malfunctioning system. If the incident cannot be reproduced by either party, or Customer did not grant access to the network environment where the incident could be reproduced, or if it is detected that the incident&#39;s cause lies beyond the Product, the incident cannot be classified within this Support Program.</p><p>An incident may at any time be either on the Customer&#39;s side (i.e. Customer is taking actions that will promote/expedite the resolution of the issue by TuxCare) or on the AlmaLinux side. An incident is on the Customer&#39;s side when TuxCare engineers request information from the Customer. When Customer provides the requested information to TuxCare, the incident is considered to be on the side of the latter. The period during which the incident may be on the Customer&#39;s side is limited to one calendar week. If the Customer&#39;s response is overdue, the incident is closed by timeout.</p><h3 id="appendices" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#appendices" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Appendices</h3><h4 id="appendix-a.-incident-severity-levels" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#appendix-a.-incident-severity-levels" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Appendix A.

The main difference is the choice of OS version - you must install the RPM specifically for your AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux version, currently 8.8, 8.10, 9.2, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 10.0 and 10.1 are supported.</p><p>If you are unsure, run this to find your exact OS version:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>$ cat /etc/almalinux-release
